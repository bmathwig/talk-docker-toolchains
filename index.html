					In many teams, developer machine setup and maintenance is cumbersome. It frequently comes down

					So what are these issues specifically? The first is dependency management and versioning. Even in a SemVer
					scheme, there can be minor differences in a build that can cause something to break. We've solved this using
					lock files;

					The second, and most problematic, is machine configuration. Small nuances with machine configuration can cause
					projects to fail compilation or runtime errors to appear. This is a pain point for a lot of developers. Virtualization
					and Vagrant attempt to solve these issues with machine configurations, but they don't account for minor differences
					in the operating system that they are configured on.

					The third is not usually a major issue, but can cause issues between individual projects on a developers machine.
					When you have various versions of a runtime installed on your machine, it can lead to compatability issues between
					libraries. This is especially true with compiled languages.

					Let's look at some typical toolchains. In the web space, we usually have a combination of web asset
					bundling tools like Webpack and Rollup, preprocessors for Javascript and CSS, web servers to server
					the application and databases to store persistant data.

					In C++, it's a bit simpler. A compiler, a make file or a metabuild system file like CMake or Ninja.
					There are also the various system shared libraries that are linked to in the build process as well as
					third party header files and library files.

					C# is even easier than C++, MsBuild takes care of a lot of the nuances associated with building
					your project via the CSPROJ files. The new 'dotnet' command line tool in .NET Core provides a great
					set of commands to manage the project. And finally the Kestrel server takes away the need for IIS
					application hosting.

					Finally, we have Go. Go is an interesting little language in that it's developer environment resembles
					an old school Smalltalk machine. Every piece of Go code on a developers machine is usually, and recommended, to
					be located in a single workspace directory. It's a different way of looking at project development and provides
					unique challenges to developers used to traditional project directory structures and packaging. Go also is
					capable of cross-building binaries for other platforms and architectures.

					COMBINATIONS OF TOOLCHAINS
				-->
			<section id="combine-problem-splash">
				<h1>Combinations?</h2>
				<aside class="notes">
					So what if we need to combine multiple technologies and stacks to 'compose' our project? One solution
					that is very popular right now is the concept of microservices. Breaking the application into smaller
					pieces and developing them independently of each other. This works great for the most part, but it still
					requires generalist programmers to maintain multiple developer environments based on their tasks in the project.

					Think about your workbench at home. How many projects to you have in-flight? If you have more than one, chances
					are that the surface of your workbench and the surrounding area is cluttered with bits and pieces of the projects
					that you are working on.

					Imagine if you could have a brand new room with a clean workbench for each project you are working on...

				<aside class="notes">
					The first is that we are able to lock our runtime versions to a version of a container. This means
					that if our legacy project depends on Ruby 1.8, we can create a developer environment container that
					only contains Ruby 1.8. We can then have new projects depend on Ruby 2X and not worry about breaking
					the legacy application.

					Following that idea, we can create self-contained developer containers that not only contain runtimes but
					also build tools used by the project. Any custom tools that are used in the development cycle of the project
					are easily accessible and require zero installation on the developer machine. We can even version this container
					and release new toolchains as the project evolves.

					We also gain the benefit of packaging for pre-production environments. We can build the application in our
					continuous integration pipeline, throw in some debugging and diagnostic tools with environment specific
					configurations and deploy them for testing.

					On local developer machines, we can also deploy an entire runtime stack on the local machine. A great
					example of this is a web application that depends on several microservices. Those microservices can be
					run in containers on the local machine without spending days setting up an environment for them to run in.

					And finally we can reduce the time to first code for a new developer from several hours to minutes.

				NPM INIT DEMO
			-->
			<section id="show-me-something">
				<h2>So What?</h2>
				<aside class="notes">
					So you're probably thinking: "Show me something!". Let's take a look at an example
					of using a Docker container to initialize a new Node project with npm init.

			<section class="full-screen-video" id="docker-npm-init" data-state="vs-npm-init">
				<video src="images/docker-npm-init.mp4"></video>
				<aside class="notes">
					Here we are using the 'docker run' command, which is used to start a new container from
					an existing image. We use -it to signal an interactive tty attachment to the container
					and mount the present working directory into the container at /projects and set this
					as the working directory in the container. We complete the command by specifying the
					image name and the command we wish to run inside the container; in this case npm init
				</aside>

					<span class="fragment visible"> node:alpine</span>
					<span class="fragment visible"> npm init .</span>
				</code>
				<aside class="notes">
					That was a bit fast, so let's break down the command into it's components.
					First we have 'docker run'. This command says to create and run a new container.
					Next we have '-it --rm', which tells Docker that this is an interactive container
					and to allocate a pseudo-TTY to the container. The 'rm' part tells Docker to remove
					this container once the main process has finished executing.

					'-v' is for volume mounting. Docker allows us to mount directories on the host machine
					inside the container at any location that we choose. In this case, we are mounting
					the current working directory into a directory called /project in the container and 
					setting the working directory to /project.

					We then specify the image that we would like to use for this container. Alpine linux
					is a minimalistic linux distibution and Node Alpine is Alpine containing just NodeJS
					binaries.

					The final argument to docker run is the command we wish to run in the container. For This
					invocation, we are running 'npm init' to create a new NPM package in the current working
					directory.

					Simple enough hey?

					we've switched the '-it' to '-dt' which signals a detached container.

				<aside class="notes">
					We can create an environment augmentation script that defines wrappers
					around common commands that we might use on a regular basis when working on
					the project. In this script we've defined two PowerShell functions, one for
					invoking NPM in the container and another to invoke the dotnet CLI command.

					This pattern is common in the Ruby and Python communities for managing Runtime

					Using this technique, we can make it appear as if we are running local commands in our
					host shell, but we are really redirecting these commands into the container context. We
					can utilize the "source script" feature of PowerShell to bring in these functions into 
					local shell context. From here we can invoke npm just we would if we had installed
